# Running Python Code in Jupyter Notebooks

This guide explains how to run the provided Python code segments, which cover a variety of topics including symbolic mathematics with SymPy, implementing gradient descent, and training a logistic regression model on noisy data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed in your environment:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SymPy
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib sympy scikit-learn
```
## Getting Started
Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook: Open your terminal, navigate to your working directory, and start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Create a New Notebook: In the Jupyter interface, create a new Python notebook.

## Running the Code
The provided code is divided into multiple segments, each serving a specific purpose, such as analyzing functions, performing gradient descent, or logistic regression modeling.

### Organizing Code and Markdown
- Code Segments: Copy and paste each code segment into separate code cells in your Jupyter notebook.

- Markdown Segments: Text sections provided should be copied into markdown cells. Remove any #%% md lines, as they are just indicators for you to switch to markdown formatting in Jupyter.

### Execution Order
Execute each cell in the order they appear after you have organized them into code and markdown cells. This is crucial for the code to run successfully since some segments depend on the output of previous ones.

### Key Steps
- Analyzing Functions: Start with importing libraries and defining symbols, then calculate and analyze derivatives and critical points.
- Implementing Gradient Descent: Define the gradient function based on previous calculations, then perform gradient descent steps.
- Logistic Regression on Noisy Data: Generate noisy datasets, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.
- Generalization Across Noise Distributions: Explore how models trained on data with one noise distribution perform on data with a different noise distribution.

## Analyzing and Interpreting Results
After running each segment, take the time to analyze outputs and interpret the significance of plots, accuracy metrics, and other results to understand the impact of various factors on model performance.

### Conclusion
This guide provides a structured approach to exploring mathematical concepts and machine learning models through hands-on experimentation in Jupyter notebooks.
